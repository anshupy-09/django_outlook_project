This guide provides instructions on how to deploy the project using Docker and Kubernetes.

## Docker Deployment

Prerequisites-

1.Docker
2.Docker Compose

## Steps

1.Build the Docker Image

docker build -t your_project_image .

2.Run the Docker Container

docker run -p 8000:8000 -d your_project_image

The project should now be accessible at http://localhost:8000.

## Kubernetes Deployment

Prerequisites-

1.kubectl
2.A running Kubernetes cluster (e.g., Minikube)

## Steps

1.Apply Kubernetes Configurations

kubectl apply -f kubernetes/
Ensure that your Kubernetes configurations (e.g., Deployment, Service, Secrets, etc.) are stored in the kubernetes/ directory.

2.Expose the Service
If not using an Ingress controller:

kubectl expose deployment your_deployment_name --type=LoadBalancer --port=8000

If using an Ingress controller, apply the appropriate Ingress configuration.
Your project should now be accessible at the provided external IP.

**Notes**

Additional deployment configurations and environment variables can be set in the respective deployment files.
Ensure that your application's database is properly configured and accessible from the deployed environment.
For more advanced deployment scenarios or specific cloud environments, refer to the respective documentation and adapt the deployment process accordingly.
