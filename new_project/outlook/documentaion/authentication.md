# Authentication

This document provides information about the authentication process in the project, particularly the Outlook OAuth authentication method.

## Outlook OAuth Authentication

The project uses Outlook OAuth as an authentication method to register and log in users. The authentication process involves the following steps:

1. **User Interaction**: Users initiate the authentication process by clicking the "Sign Up" or "Log In" buttons in the project's web interface.

2. **Outlook Authentication**: Users are redirected to the Microsoft Outlook authentication page, where they sign in with their Outlook credentials.

3. **OAuth Consent**: Upon successful authentication, the user is asked for consent to access their Outlook data, as configured in the project's Microsoft Developer Portal settings.

4. **Redirect to Project**: After granting consent, users are redirected back to the project site as authenticated users.

5. **User Profile**: User data is retrieved from Outlook, and a user profile is created or updated in the project's database.

6. **Logged In**: Users are now logged in and have access to the project's features.

## Authorization

Once authenticated, users may have different levels of access based on their roles or permissions. Ensure that your project defines proper authorization mechanisms to control access to specific resources or features.

## Security Considerations

- Protect sensitive information such as your Outlook OAuth App ID and App Secret. Store these securely as environment variables.

- Ensure that you use secure connections (HTTPS) when implementing OAuth authentication.

- Regularly update your project dependencies, including Django, Django Rest Framework, and social auth libraries, to address security vulnerabilities.

## Conclusion

Outlook OAuth authentication provides a secure method for users to register and log in to the project. Understanding the authentication and security considerations is essential to maintain the integrity of user data and project resources.
